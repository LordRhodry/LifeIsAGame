									<h3>Live to play or Play to live?</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											Some devote their whole life to games. They <i>live to play</i> games and call themselves gamers, pro-gamers or just 1337. On the other hand, I <b>know</b> that playing and games are essential to live an healthy life. They need to be an integral part of the life not only of kids that are still developing but also of adults. It's not just me, everyone needs to <i>play to live</i>.<br> But Stuart Brown explained that way better than I ever would during <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/stuart_brown_says_play_is_more_than_fun_it_s_vital" target=blank>Ted Talk in May 2008</a> 
										</p>
										<p>
											It would be a blatant lie to pretend I am not a gamer. But I'm not just a gamer. I'm also making sure that <b>Life Is A Game</b> and that as many of the  players as possible are enjoying it. I'm designing games, programming some, testing others, but mostly managing team creating them. I'm hosting events to teach new games (board games card game and more). I try hard to look at the world's happiness gauge and make sure it keeps filling up.<br> What I am is a game-maker, a game-teacher and of course a game-player.
										</p>
										<p>
											So yes, when life throws challenges at me, when problems arise, or just when we try to find ways to improve... I'm game! There is nothing I enjoy more than evaluating parameters and finding innovative solutions. And where people have decided to better the world through research, by helping others via medicine, heroism or charity, I joined the game industry.

									<h3>Joining the game industry</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											We are in 2008, and a Math teacher has one more of the same class, teaching the same topic, for the 12th time in 6 years. He feels good helping kids learn Math, but feels he could do more and have a less repetitive life.
										</p>
										<p>
											Time passed and it's now time to go back to school in 2010. A middle school is missing a math teacher: he is one of the 5 students in the Project management speciality of <a href="http://http://www.cnam-enjmin.fr/en/cnam-enjmin/presentation" target="blank">ENJMIN</a>'s Game design master program.
										</p>
										<p>
											May 2011, at TIMM (Transmedia International Masterclass Marseille), James Bower CEO of Numedeon, Inc. explains how kids learn in Whyville, not through dry textbook lesson but by experimenting simulations in a virtual world. Both the teacher and the Game Designer are convinced that this is a perfect fit for both his former teacher experience and his newly acquired skills. He applies for an internship. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Today Our former Math teacher is a project manager at <a href="http://www.numedeon.com" target="blamk">Numedeon, Inc.</a>. He also get opportunities to design and even programm some of the games and activity developped by the company.

									<h3>Background</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											Born in France, Julien(aka me) was an early adopter of board games and card games. And when he couldn't find the right game he tried to imagine new ones using dice, paper and legos.
										</p>
										<p>
											In 2003, he became a certified Math teacher in France, which he kept doing till 2010. His teacher certification thesis was about using games in classroom to improve student interest for Math.
										</p>
										<p>
											Teaching wasn't enough for him and he started many projects to offer extra curricular activities to his students (including games, acting classes or Math competitions).
										</p>
										<p>
											Reliable and with a talent for organization, he would often manage rosters and paperwork for the sports team he was involved with(ping pong).
										</p>
										<p>
											When he joined ENJMIN, the graduate school of game design, he volunteered and was elected as one of the 2 class representatives and helped make many student projects happen (coordination and team building including for project he wasn't involved in).
